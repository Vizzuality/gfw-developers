<p>GFW aims to radically improve the availability, quality, and accessibility of forest data for everyone:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Governments can use GFW to detect illegal forest clearing and target forest law enforcement efforts.</li>
  <li>NGOs & civil society can identify deforestation hotspots and bolster their investigations, advocacy, and campaigns.</li>
  <li>Indigenous communities can monitor their territories and raise an alarm when their customary forests are threatened.</li>
  <li>Media can gather evidence, data, and graphics for reporting.</li>
  <li>Researchers can analyze forest trends on a local or global scale and better understand the causes of forest change.</li>
  <li>Concerned citizens everywhere can learn more about the state of forests and participate in forest monitoring. Students and educators can learn more about forests at local and global scales.</li>
</ul>
